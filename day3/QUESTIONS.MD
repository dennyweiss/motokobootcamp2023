2. True or False: when I realize an update call, the boundary node will participate in the consensus but not during query calls.

    > Every now and then someone asks whether Motoko canisters can use certified variables, or whether they can serve HTTP requests with certification, and I always responded that yes, Motoko can do that, all thatâ€™s missing are a few libraries.

    ```motoko
    actor {
        public func hello(name : Text) : async Text {
            return ("hello # name");
        };
    }
    ```
